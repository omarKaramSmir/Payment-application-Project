# Data structures project # 

# Aim #
This project working on developing a GUI based program to parse and visualize an XML file representing users in a social network
, Each user has id (unique), name, list of posts, list of followers.Each post has text and list of topics.

# project description # 
In this project we will work on some processes on the xml file :
  1- Formatting (Prettifying) the XML: the XML file should be well formatted by keeping the 
indentation for each level.
   2- Converting XML to JSON: JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is another format that is used 
to represent data as It’s helpful to convert the XML into JSON, especially when using 
javascript as there’s tons of libraries and tools that use json notation.  
   3- Minifying the XML file: Since spaces and newlines (\n) are actually characters that can 
increase the size of an XML document. This feature should aim at decreasing the size of 
an XML file (compressing it) by deleting the whitespaces and indentations.
   4- Compressing the data in the XML/JSON file: You should come-up with a way to reduce the 
size of the file using a data compression technique. 
   5- Decompressing the compressed data to return to its original format.
   6- detecting and visually show any errors in consistency & The program is also be able to solve the errors.
